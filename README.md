# Warranty Verification system


This system is useful to determine whether a product sold off by one of our retailers is eligible for our company warranty or not.
When the products are about to be sold off to the retailers, this system generates a unique number which will be required for customer services and ensuring warranties. This system includes a verification using the unique warranty number and mobile SMS confirmations. This project was created using PHP script. It uses an SMS gateway integration that enabled communication between the customers and the company server to get information for warranty services.

Before the creation of this system, it was to hard to detect the company's original products from other inauthentic machines. Therefore, it was harder to maintain customer service and warranty expenses. This system allowed verification and limited the warranty services to only the authentic customers of the company's original products.
